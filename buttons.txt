INSTRUCTIONS:
I would like to have a starting menu. So when when the game starts
- the total wood is not displayed
- there is a big title written "Tiny Realm" (the name of the game)
- Below there is one button "Play"
- Below another one named "Help"

SPECIFICATIONS FOR THE GAME TITLE:
- I added a tile layer called "MenuBackground" in the map-test2.json
- I added an object layer called "MenuText" in the map-test2.json
- Display them correctly

SPECIFICATIONS FOR THE BUTTONS:
- Let's use a 9 slice system. I will give you the 9 tiles (8x8 pixels), from the Inputs.png image
- Inputs.png is 30 columns wide
for the "unselected" state:
- Upper left is frame 600, upper 601, upper right 604
- left is 630, middle is 631, right is 634
- bottom left is 660, bottom is 661, bottom right is 664
for the selected state, add +5 to the current frame
for a nice addition, display the shadows below the buttons, using the selected or unselected current frame +20
